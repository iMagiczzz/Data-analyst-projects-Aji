## Here’s my project list so far:

### 📝 SQL Project: 
["Awesome Chocolates Sales" Analysis](https://github.com/iMagiczzz/Data-analyst-projects-Aji/blob/main/product-data.sql) 
**Skills**: SQL (querying, joins, aggregation & grouping, date/time functions), data analysis & reporting.

### 📈 Key Findings:
- Transactions with Amount >2,000 often involved <100 boxes, indicating high-value sales.
- In January 2022, sales activity varied significantly across salespersons.
- Between Milk Bars and Eclairs, product performance differed depending on sales value vs box volume.
- Shipments exceeding 1,000 boxes occurred multiple times each month, showing seasonal demand patterns.
- Australia purchased more chocolate boxes than India on a monthly basis.
- Some salespersons made zero shipments in the first 7 days of January 2022.

### 💡 Business Insights:
- Should prioritize promotion of high-revenue products.
- Should review performance of inactive salespersons.
- Should prepare inventory ahead of high-volume shipment months.
- Should focus regional strategy on stronger markets like Australia.
